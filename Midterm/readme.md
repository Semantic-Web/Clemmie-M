Our Project Proposal (Midterm) is about the following Project Topic.

Here is the link to SUMO in .owl: http://www.adampease.org/OP/ -- it is listed under "Documentation and other resources." 
When I imported it, the SUMO ontology was flattened - that is, the MISO entries were at the highest level with Entity etc 
of the SUMO ontology. Go online and determine if there is a solution; if not, review the .owl file to see where the error 
was made and get it right. As a last alternative, import part of the .owl file and add incrementally the remainder. This 
may require you to use Python to systematically achieve that. Project for one student. Publishable as a paper. Mr. Pease, 
the creator of SUMO, is available to guide and advise.
