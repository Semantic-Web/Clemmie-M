Essentially DCAT will allow us to find all related data across multiple data.gov/ federal data sites. 
Try to find related data across databases (see data.gov)  to answer  slightly complicated questions. 
For example, you will have to use census data to find ethnic backgrounds and ages in various US regions 
and data from HealthData.gov on mortality and morbidity rates, or data on educational institutions (via data.gov) . 
Then, pose some question such as: Is health or education coverage worse in some regions and relate it to data from the 
US Census Bureau. This is just a suggestion. The idea is to use DCAT front-end to access data from two government data 
sets, as per your passion and background, and relate them using simple data analytics. A simple data analytic is to find 
the average for the entire US and define arbitrarily half that of that as the threshold  to define under-coverage,or 
one--and-a-half that value as the threshold to define over-coverage. The primary goal here is to integrate data across 
two data sets, using the DCAT interface. Any simple type of data analytics is fine. Do screen captures, and upload the 
code, screen captures, and a short paper to Github.

What my code does:

I gathered two rdf files - one reporting all driving deaths in region 1 of the United States and one reporting all 
alcohol involved driving deaths in region 1 of the United Stated. I used python code to combine these two sets of data
and printed a table with the output and a double bar graph showing the rate of deaths for all driving and rate of death
for drivers who had been drinking.
